Given an initial attitude parametrization provided by an Euler angle set of three successive (yaw-pitch-roll, i.e.
3-2-1) rotations, and a provided instantaneous body angular velocity vector (omega), find the attitude of the 
spacecraft after a given time, through integrating the kinematic differential equation, which is composed of the
given Euler angles and the given omega vector.

Omega, usually measured by the rate gyro of the spacecraft, is the instantaneous angular velocity vector of 
frame B (body frame) relative to N (inertial frame). To solve the kinematic differential equation, we have to relate
the Euler angles (which do NOT represent a vector in the mathematical sense) to the omega vector (which IS a real
vector, comprised of magnitude x direction). We do this by multiplying the (inverse of the matrix representation
of the) mappings of the Euler successive rotations to the B frame with the respective omega components
(omega 1, 2, 3). Thus we find the instantaneous rates of change of the Euler angle set components.

We compose the 3x3 matrix in the function f by setting the three successive body rotations relative to the
B frame (translate into B frame components). To do this, we express the b unit vector components which are
modified through the successive rotations to the (b1, b2, b3) vectors.
For example, after the pitch rotation about the second angle, we get a new b2 component, let's call it b2'. We
need to express this new b2' in terms of B (b1,b2,b3) (map it to B). In other words, after 
the pitch (2 axis) rotation, where is b2' relative to the B frame components.
This way, we can use the canonical formula for finding the omega vector:
omega = omega1*b1+omega2*b2+omega3*b3, just by setting the derivatives of our three Euler angles as omega1, 2 and 3,
respectively, and the aforementioned transformed b coordinates as b1, 2, and 3, respectively.
We 'linearize' these three coordinate transformations by constructing a 3x3 matrix (NOT a DCM, just similar) 
made up of these three respective components.
For a 3-2-1 Euler angle set this results in a matrix as depicted in function f:

[[-np.sin(y[1]), 0, 1], [np.sin(y[2])*np.cos(y[1]), np.cos(y[2]), 0], [np.cos(y[2])*np.cos(y[1]), -np.sin(y[2]), 0]]

where y[1] and y[2] represent the pitch and roll components of the resulting 'y' Euler angle set. We don't need to
manipulate the yaw component since it is the first rotation and therefore we can use the (1 0 0) identity.

Finding the instantaneous angular velocity vector (which is a proper vector, direction x magnitude) now requires
multiplying the rates of change of the Euler angles with the body transformations (which, as stated above, are
represented in the compact 3x3 matrix format). 

Here, we already have omega, which then enables us to extract the instantaneous rates of change of the Euler
angles, hence of the spacecraft attitude. This is done by the Euler angles kinematic differential equation which
is the inverse of the kinematic equation for finding omega (essentially omega1*b1+omega2*b2+omega3*b3). 
Therefore we take the dot product of the inverted matrix with the coordinate transformation and the (provided) 
omega vector.

Then, given the initial set of Euler angles, we can integrate the resulting 'yawdot', 'pitchdot' and 'rolldot' to
find the new attitude after a certain time (42 seconds in below case).

The known singularity problem manifests itself in the inversion of the 3x3 mapping matri, since here we need to 
multiply the matrix and the omega vector by 1/cos(pitch component, i.e. 2nd angle). Setting the pitch angle to 90Â° 
results in a division by zero.
